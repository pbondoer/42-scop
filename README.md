# scop @ 42

This is a graphical project at 42. The objective is to parse .OBJ files and
display them using modern OpenGL with a few constraints.

## Compiling
Make sure you have the libraries by running `git submodule init`.
You may compile the executable `scop` by running `make`.

## Features
Currently none, as I have just started the project!

## Usage
Just run `./scop` after compiling. A window should open up.
